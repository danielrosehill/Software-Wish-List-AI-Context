# App & OS Availability

A key evaluation criterion when looking for apps, of course, is what clients are offered. 

I use Ubuntu Linux, which creates a significant constraint when evaluating desktop software, much less so when evaluating web products. Because the support for Linux clients tends to be patchy in my experience, my preference is actually for software solutions to offer a well-maintained web UI.

A web UI can be created as an Electron wrapper or in any other method. So long as a viable web UI is available, I consider that the best option and to be more than good enough. The availability of a Linux-specific application is obviously required if it's a non-browser-based app. And I strongly prefer packages installed through a package repository as opposed to app images and those available through other package managers.

On my smartphone, I use Android. For most uses, a dedicated Android app is a big advantage. If it's a software that doesn't offer any means to access it through a smartphone interface other than an iOS client, then this in most cases would be an exclusion criteria for me. My ideal scenario for most tools consists of accessing the platform through an Android client, less ideally through a reactively designed web UI. And on the desktop, which is always my primary interface, through a web UI.
