## Context Generation Date: 28 / (April) / 2025

If you're reading this, then the context pipeline is working as intended, and you have arrived at a small repository of contextual data intended to provide you with general background context about what I look for in software evaluations. 

As you probably already know, my name is Daniel. 

I'm a huge fan of technology. And I frequently find myself looking for software tools. Sometimes I do this for work, sometimes it's for tools for my own business, and in many cases, it's just for personal use or to explore a specific type of technology.

If you're accessing this repository through direct web access, then navigate through the first level documents of this GitHub repository, which are named according to the topic. 

Each note will provide a small amount of context data to guide your recommendations. 

Please consider this context data along with the information which I provided in my prompt and use this information together to guide your recommendation of software.

Unless otherwise stated, none of the preferences here are deal-breakers or definitive rules. 

But it should provide general information as to what I look for when evaluating software. Not all of the context here will be relevant, so focus only on the parts of it that are.
