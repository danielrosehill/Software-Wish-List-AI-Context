# Evaluating "Backupability" In SaaS Tools (And Others)

A feature that I look for when evaluating serious software is what might be called "backupability." 

In other words, how easy is it for consumers to backup the data they commit to the app or service? 

Unfortunately, many software vendors, whether they provide their software through SaaS or any other model, offer very little in this regard. This is why an API is also something that I look for, as it can often provide a workaround solution for users who wish to create their own backup strategies.

To give an example: if I were looking for a CRM for my business, I'd want to be able to replicate the data ideally to both an on-site and additional off-site store at a regular interval, perhaps once a week. For backups to be worthwhile, in my view, they need to be automated, easy to configure, and easy to run. They should happen almost effortlessly in the background.

For cloud storage, I use Wasabi and B2, but I would be happy to use S3 if that were an option. Many providers only offer data exports which need to be manually initiated. This is better than nothing but is very far from the standard that I like to see in a provider because it precludes automation, precludes an incremental approach to data management, is inefficient, and ultimately means that it's very unlikely that I'm going to follow through with it.

If there are multiple software options that are very comparable, but one vendor has clearly made some effort to provide workable backup solutions to consumers, then this is a very strong factor in that vendor's favor in my assessments.
