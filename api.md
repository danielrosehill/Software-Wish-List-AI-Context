# API Friendliness

A significant advantage in any product or software that I'm evaluating is whether the tool offers a robust and well-documented API. Given that I do a lot of work with AI tools, and also because I think that these tools are the future, two things stand out as particularly important in this regard:

- The first is an API that is maintained as open API compliant JSON. Machine-readable APIs in this format at the time I'm writing this context mean that the API can be integrated with AI workflows with much greater ease. 
- The second useful thing emerging at the time I'm authoring this context data is a MCP server. MCP stands for Model Code Context Protocol and is the protocol for interacting with APIs being spearheaded by Anthropic. At the time I'm writing this, MCP servers are springing up left and right. Many of these are community projects, and early adopters are often finding that they are buggier than one would like. For this reason, an official OEM or vendor-provided MCP server is my strong preference and is a very significant advantage in my view.

Regarding the API itself, I like to use N8N to integrate tools and technologies. 

So a well-documented API with lots of functionality is an advantage. 

Another advantage for automation is functionality for webhooks. Pushing from the service to other ones also opens up plenty of potential automations.
