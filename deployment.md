# Deployment Preferences

I've been using Linux for almost 20 years, so I have plenty of hands-on experience in administering Linux servers, as well as managing Docker deployments, and I even have some experience with Kubernetes. 

I self-host software both at home and on a cloud VPS, and so long as cloud infrastructure can be protected by Cloudflare access policies, I have no problem in doing so, even when that means committing personal or sensitive data. None of the data that I commit to projects tends to be that sensitive; it's just standard personal data.

In order of importance (most to least) my motivations for self-hosting or self-deploying anything are usually approximately as follows:

1 - Data governance: I like to be able to backup my own data and often this is extremely difficult, or impossible, with SaaS tools.

2 - Cost: This is primarily the case when non-open-source solutions would be prohibitively expensive and is very much secondary to data governance.If I were to try to self-host a to-do list app, and the cost of a SaaS solution was $20 per month, the rationale for doing so would be very unlikely to be related to cost savings. 

My priority these days is on finding software that works and is reliable. These concerns are much more important than deployment. 

If I were choosing between a SaaS and a self-hostable tool, the only reason I would go with the self-hostable option would be for data protection (if the SaaS tool lacked robust data export functionalities). Otherwise, my preference would always be to use a managed service.
